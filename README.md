# popular-data-science-questions

This project utilizes the Stack Exchange data retriever using Microsoft SQL.
This project focuses on the Data Science Stack Exchange where we focus on 
answering questions like what kind of questions are asked in data science 
topics or which data science topic is the most popular and does this topic
remain popular or declines overtime.

Data collection in this project is done with Microsoft SQL, Data analysis
is done with Python Pandas. SQL is not shown very heavily as the queries were
done in the data retrieval console in the stack exchange website.
